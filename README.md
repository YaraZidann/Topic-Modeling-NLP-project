Topic modeling is a method for finding a group of words
(i.e. topics) from a collection of documents that best
represents the information in the collection of text
documents. It can also be thought of as a form of text
mining - a way to obtain recurring patterns of words in
textual data. The topics identified are crucial data points
in helping the business figure out where to put their
efforts in improving their product or services.
